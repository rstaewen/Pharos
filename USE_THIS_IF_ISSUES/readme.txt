this is a link to a unitypackage with all dependencies included. The package was too big for github size constraints, so I'm linking it instead.

Use this if you have problems with the cloning process (you definitely will). Once the package is loaded into a new project in the Documents/Github/Pharos directory, please use github to sync again.

For whatever reason, the files load in the wrong order when you github clone. You can do it this way to circumvent that, then sync asset files normally. I hope.
